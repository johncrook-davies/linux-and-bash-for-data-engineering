# Linux and Bash for data engineering - notes
## Bash scripts
### Core concepts
* `shebang` line - tels script what language to use to execute the script eg. invoke bash or invoke python eg `#!/bin/bash` or `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
* `chmod` - makes script executable, it changes characteristics of the script to give it an executable flag
* config files and variables
  - `.bashrc` - configure so that every new invokation of a terminal will run what is inside the bashrc - this enables building of alias' that automate tasks
  - `.profie` - good for setup
* searching for files -
  - `Find` - performs an exhaustive search of a file system
  - `Locate` - searches metadata only and is much quicker
### Using Linux
#### Intro
* Ubuntu and Red Hat are the most popular forms of Linux
* Easiest way to run linux is with docker with command
```bash
  docker run -it ubuntu
```
#### Useful locations
* `/usr/bin` - the location of most command executables
* `/dev/null` - the trash
* `.ssh` - storage for secure keys
#### Github codespaces
* Cloudspaces enables you to edit and run in the cloud rather than cloning locally - it is essentially an IDE
#### Useful linux commands
* The core structure of commands is:
```bash
 [cmd] -[option] [target]
```
* Most commands are located in `/usr/bin`
* see all the available commands in `/usr/bin` with the command:
```bash
 ls -l /usr/bin
```
* A useful command when firing up a codespace is
```bash
  uname -a
```
which gives all the information about the operating system
* `[Ctrl] + [z]` - stops a process rather than killing it
* `fg [process id or script name]` - resumes a stopped process or returns it to the foreground
* `jobs` - lists jobs
* You can create variables by putting the `$` sign before it:
```bash
 newvar = $'this is a new var'
```
* You can create global variables with:
```bash
 export newvar = 'this is a new var'
```
* Note that in the `history` you can run any command again by just typing:
```bash
 ![line number of command]
```
* You can also fun the last command run with:
```bash
 !!
```
* `[cmd] -[option] [target] &` - runs a process but runs it in the background
* `[cmd] -[option] [target] && [cmd] -[option] [target]` - if first commmand works well then run second command, if first command fails then the second command will not run
* `pwd` - shows the directory that you're in at the moment
* `cat [filename]` - prints the file to the terminal
* `less [filename]` - prints the file to the terminal and paginates
* `wc -l [filename]` - counts lines of file
* `vim [filename]` - opens the vim editor
* `ls -l [filename]` - lists file permissions for root user, group and user
* `chmd +x [filename]` - makes file executable globally to all users
* `[filename]` - execute an executable file
* `cal` - gives calendar day
* `date` - gives time and date
* `which [cmd]` - shows where command executable is located
* `df -h` - shows disk usage in human readable format
* `du -sh [filepash]/*` - shows disk useage of all files in a folder
* `top` - shows what's happening on the machine
* `ls -lah` - prints a summar of files, sizes, permissions and modified dates
* `mv [current location] [desired destination]` - can move and rename files
* `mkdir -p [long file path]` - creates multiple files
* `grep [pattern being searched for] [thing to be searched]` - search thing for certain pattern
* `grep -v [pattern not being searched for] [thing to be searched]` - search thing for everything other than certain pattern
* `grep -c [pattern being searched for] [thing to be searched]` - count occurences of certain pattern
* `grep -e [first pattern being searched for] -e [second pattern being searched for] [thing to be searched]` - search thing for multiple patterns
*  `tail -f [filename]` - keep a file open and print it to the terminal - every time the file changes then change the terminal
*  `tail -n [number of lines to print] [filename]` - just print the last n lines of a file
*  `head -n [number of lines to print] [filename]` - just print the first n lines of a file
* `history` - list the history of commands in to the terminal
* `whoami` - outputs username
* `curl [IP address]` - send a HTTP request
* `shuf -n [number of lines to output]` - shuffle and return a sample f n lines of a file
* `echo $SHELL` - prints the location of the executable for the shell that you're using so you can find out what shell you're on
* `alias` - lists all alias code
* `readlink -f [filename]` - returns full filepath of file
* `tr [thing to use as replacement] [thing to replace] [input]` - find instances of the thing to replace and replace them with the replacement
* `echo $RANDOM` - outputs a random number
* `find . -name "*.sh"` - find all files in current directory with shell extension
* `find . -perm /+x` - find all executable files in current directory
* `find . ! -name '.*' -type f` - find everything in current directory that isn't hidden and is a file
* `find . -not -path '*/\.*'` - find everything in current directory that isn't in a hidden directory
#### Shell piping
Essentially this is about input, some processing and then output.
A standard piping line of code might look something like this:
```bash
 [cmd] -[option] [target] | [cmd] -[option] > [output filename]
```
##### Examples
* Output a variable to a file:
```bash
 echo "$variable" > intothisfile.txt
```
* Sort
```bash
 cat intothisfile.txt | sort
```
* Count number of unique occurrences of each thing
```bash
 echo -e "A\nB\nC\nA" | sort | uniq -c
```
* Reverse an input
```bash
 echo 1993 | rev
```
* Search
```bash
 cat intothisfile.txt | grep 'thingtobefound'
```
* Appending to a file
```bash
 echo "something" >> intothisfile.txt
```
* Throw away errors
```bash
 ls -l /wrong/path >> /dev/null
```
* Output a scrollable history of commands
```bash
 history | less
```
* Search for a past command
```bash
 history | grep [thing to be searched for]
```
#### Using SSH
SSH enables you to shell into a server to run commands or even remotely run commands across machines. GitHub also relies on SSH. You can also forward a port on a remote machine to your own port.
* `ssh-keygen -t nameofkey` - create a public and a private key that can be used for ssh operations, the public key can be given to a third party for authentication
* To ssh into a machine:
 1. Add the public key into the `known_hosts` or `authorised_keys` file in the `.ssh` folder of the host machine
 2. On the client machine type the command:
 ```bash
  ssh -v username@[IP address of host]
 ```
* port forwarding - you can forward a port from a remote server to a local port using:
```bash
 ssh -N -L 8080:[local.machine.ip.address]:8080 [user@ip.address.of.host]
```
This enables you to communicate with that server via a web browser.
#### Useful tools
* `htop` - advanced and pretty version of `top`
* `oh-my-zsh` - posh terminal
### Configuring the shell environment
#### Shell config files
Shell config files are a form of automation and may contain:
* alias - shortcuts for lines of code
* source - the bashrc file may source other custom command files
* functions - bash custom functions
* file system mounts
#### bashrc
Examples:
* Add API keys into `.bashrc` and `export` them to add to global variables
 ```bash
  export pathToAPIKeys="/path/to/api/keys/apiKeys.sh"
  # where apiKeys.sh looks something like this:
  # export SECRET_ONE = 123
  # export SECRET_TWO = 456
  source $pathToAPIKeys
 ```
* Spin up a global python virtual environment
 ```bash
  source ~/.venv/bin/activate
 ```
* Set the context for project work automatically:
 ```bash
  alias switchToProject="cd /project/directory && source /project/directors/environmentFile.sh"
 ```
#### Configuring third party tools
With oh-my-zsh you can edit the `~/.zshrc` tp customise the shell. To apply changes just type:
 ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
 ```
* You can edit the plugin line to add more customisation
#### Shell variables
Shell variables are a way of storing data that you can use later in scripts. A `.env` file is a good example - this will be ignored by git but will have all the variables you need for your work.
Create a shell variable with:
```bash
 export FOOD="apple"
 # Use like echo "I love" $FOOD
```
Shell variables autocomplete by pressing `TAB`.
Variables will still exist in child shells. However if the `export` command is not used eg. `VAR=1` then the variable will not persist to child shells.
Using `source` means you can go into a script and add environment variables to the parent environment.
`script` however has no access to the parent environment and can only access variables in the child shell. Variables exported when running a script are not accessible in the parent shell.
#### Standard streams - Standard In, Standard Out and Standard Error
A way of capturing data into an input and filtering it.
##### Standard out
Standard out is the piping described abover in the 'Shell piping' section.
##### Standard in
* Ask for user input
```bash
 read -p "Input for variable VARI" VARI
```
* Feed files straight into commands
```bash
 less < [filename]
```
##### Standard error
* Write error to a file
```bash
 ls -l /wrong/path >> error.txt
```
*  Throw away error
```bash
 ls -l /wrong/path >> /dev/null
```
### Bash scripts
#### Anatomy
* Set strict mode (shell will exit when a command fails)
 ```bash
  set -e
 ```
* Enable printing of shell input lines as they are read
```bash
 set -v
```
* Enable printing of command traces before executing the command
```bash
 set -x
```
* Enable verbose debugging mode in shebang
```bash
 #!/usr.bin.bash -xv
```
#### Logic and control flow
* If else statements
```bash
 if ["$VARI" = "thing"]; then
  echo "we did something"
 elif ["$VARI" = "another thing"]; then
  echo "we did something else"
 else
  echo "do the default thing"
 fi
```
* For loops
```bash
 for i in "${array[@]}"
 do
  echo "this is a ${i}"
 done
```
```bash
 for thing in first second last;
 do echo "this is the $thing thing":
 done
```
* While loops
```bash
COUNT=1
 while [ $COUNT -le 10 ]
 do
  echo "outputting the number ${i}"
  ((COUNT++))
 done
```
* Logical operators
 - and - `&&` run both commands only if first works eg. `false && echo "this never runs"`
 - or - `||` run second command only if first fails eg. `false && echo "this always runs"`
#### Shell techniques for data
* Truncate - `head` or `tail`
* Filter - `grep` or `cut`
* Search - `find` or `locate`
#### Bash functions
There is no return in bash functions but you can echo the result and capture the echo.
```bash
 function_name() {
  #...commands refering to variables like $1 $2 $3
 }
 # call this function with function_name param1 param2
```
For example:
```bash
 add() {
  num1=$1
  num2=$2
  result=$((num1 +num2))
  echo $result
 }
 # add 3 4 returns 7
```
#### Command line tools
Calling a command line script looks like this:
```bash
 ./command-line-tool.sh --var1 1 --var2 "var2"
```
`var1` is referred to by the bash function in the shell script as `$1` and similarly `var2 is referred to by `$2`
#### Makefiles
Makefiles can contain multiple blocks of code than can be run independently eg.
```make
first:
 echo "This is the first thing"
second:
 echo "This is the second thing"
all: -first -second

# run with make first or make second or make
```
#### Data structures
* arrays -
 ```bash
  declare -a array=(1 2 3 4 5)
 ```
* hashes -
 ```bash
  declare -A hash=([one]="red" [two]="blue")
  # This can be used like
  for key in "${!hash[@]}"; do
   echo "$key is ${hash[$key]}"
  done
 ```
### Useful notes
* In vim, you can use the command `:set paste` to paste from your clipboard
* In vim, `:wq` writes and then quits
